## Ingredients

### For the Pasta:
- 250g of fettuccine or spaghetti
- Salt (for boiling the pasta)
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil

### For the Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons of butter

- Salt and pepper to taste

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Pasta

- **Boil Water**: Fill a large pot with water, add a generous amount of salt (this adds flavor to the pasta), and bring it to a boil over high heat.
- **Cook the Pasta**: Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes, until al dente (slightly firm to the bite).
- **Drain the Pasta**: Drain the cooked pasta in a colander and drizzle a small amount of olive oil over it to prevent sticking. Set aside while you prepare the sauce.

### 2. Make the Sauce

- **Melt the Butter**: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
- **Sauté the Garlic**: Add the minced garlic to the butter and sauté for about 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning. The garlic should become fragrant but not brown.
- **Add the Cream**: Pour the heavy cream into the skillet and stir well. Let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until it thickens slightly.
- **Add the Parmesan Cheese**: Gradually add the grated parmesan cheese, stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### 3. Combine Pasta and Sauce

- **Add the Pasta to the Sauce**: Place the cooked pasta in the skillet with the sauce. Toss the pasta gently to coat it evenly in the creamy garlic parmesan sauce.
- **Simmer**: Allow the pasta to simmer in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes to let the flavors blend and the sauce thicken slightly.

### 4. Serve

- **Plate the Pasta**: Serve the pasta in individual bowls or on a large serving plate.
- **Garnish**: Sprinkle chopped parsley over the top for a fresh finish.

## Texture, Smell, and Taste of the Pasta

The dish has a wonderful aroma of garlic and parmesan, with a hint of butter. The smell is inviting and savory, setting the stage for a delicious meal.

### **Taste**
This pasta is rich, creamy, and full of flavor. The garlic adds a slightly sharp, aromatic taste that balances well with the mildness of the cream. The parmesan cheese adds a nutty, savory depth, making each bite comforting and satisfying.
