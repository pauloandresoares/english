# Typical Brazilian Dishes with Cassava

Before exploring the world of cassava-based dishes, it’s important to recognize that this is just one branch of Brazilian cuisine. The country's dishes often include a variety of fruits, seafood, and regional spices, highlighting the rich and varied food culture across Brazil.

Cassava is a versatile and essential root in Brazilian cuisine, used in typical dishes across the country. In the Northeast, it is common to eat boiled cassava with dried meat, a dish that combines the soft texture of cassava with the intense flavor of salted and ***shredded meat***, often served with onions and regional spices. This dish is usually served with *manteiga de garrafa*, a type of clarified liquid butter typical of the Northeast. This butter is made by heating and separating the fat from the whey, resulting in a butter with an intense flavor and a liquid texture. It is stored in bottles and adds extra flavor to regional dishes.

## Cassava Cake / Bolo de Mandioca

*Bolo de mandioca*, or cassava cake, is a popular dessert in Brazil with a unique texture and flavor. The cake is dense and ***moist***, with a creamy interior and a ***slightly*** ***crispy*** ***crust*** that adds an enjoyable ***crunch*** with every bite. Its flavor is naturally sweet and ***earthy***, highlighting the taste of cassava itself. There are also delicious variations, like bolo de mandioca com goiabada, which includes slices of guava paste that melt into the cake, adding a touch of fruity sweetness. Another popular variation is with requeijão, a creamy Brazilian cheese spread similar to cream cheese, which brings a savory contrast to the sweet cassava base.

## Pirão

Besides these, cassava is an ingredient in many other dishes, such as *pirão*. Pirão is made with fish, meat, or chicken broth mixed with cassava flour. Because cassava flour has starch, it ***thickens*** ***the broth***, creating a creamy texture and comforting flavor. Different types of pirão are enjoyed with various meats, making it an ideal companion to main dishes and ***enhancing*** their flavors.

Other traditional cassava dishes include *vaca atolada*, a stew of ribs with cassava, and *beiju*, an indigenous delicacy made from pressed and baked cassava dough.

Another important cassava product is **polvilho**, which is the starch extracted from the root. Sweet *polvilho* is pure dry ***starch***, while ***sour*** *polvilho* is fermented before drying, which gives it a slightly acidic flavor. It is essential in recipes like *pão de queijo* (cheese bread), which uses sweet or sour polvilho to achieve a crispy outside and soft inside, as well as polvilho ***biscuits*** and the traditional *biscoito de vento*, common in various regions of Brazil.

<p>In nutritional terms, cassava is a source of complex carbohydrates, similar to potatoes and rice, but has a lower glycemic index, which provides a slower and more sustained release of energy. It is rich in fiber, which helps with satiety and digestion. Compared to other carbohydrates, cassava is naturally gluten-free, making it a great option for people with ***dietary*** restrictions. It also contains small amounts of B vitamins and minerals like calcium and potassium, which are essential for bone and muscle health. This makes cassava an energetic and versatile food, suitable for various diets and lifestyles.</p>
