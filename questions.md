# Questions


Here’s a basic summary of how to form questions in English, covering different types with practical examples for better understanding.

## 1. **Yes/No Questions**

These questions can be answered with "Yes" or "No." To form them, switch the order of the subject and auxiliary verb.

### Structure
- **Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### Examples
- **Are you coming to the meeting today?**  
  (Yes, I’ll be there at 10 a.m. / No, I have a conflict.)
- **Do you know how to cook Italian food?**  
  (Yes, I love cooking pasta! / No, but I’d love to learn.)
- **Did they finish the project on time?**  
  (Yes, they finished it yesterday. / No, they had some delays.)

**Tip:** Use "do" in the present and "did" in the past, except when the main verb is "to be."

## 2. **Wh- Questions**

These questions start with a question word like *what*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *who*, *how*, etc., and are used to get specific information.

### Structure
- **Wh- Word + Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### Examples
- **What are you planning to do this weekend?**  
  (I’m planning to go hiking in the mountains.)
- **Where do you usually spend your vacations?**  
  (I usually travel to the beach in the summer.)
- **When did they arrive at the hotel?**  
  (They arrived late last night, around midnight.)
- **Why is she upset about the news?**  
  (She received some unexpected information about her job.)
- **Who organized the event?**  
  (The marketing team organized everything.)
- **How do you manage your time effectively?**  
  (I use a planner and set daily goals.)

**Tip:** With the verb "to be," use it as the auxiliary verb without "do" or "did."

## 3. **Questions with Modal Verbs**

Modal verbs (*can*, *could*, *will*, *would*, *should*, etc.) are used to express possibility, permission, suggestions, and more.

### Structure
- **Modal Verb + Subject + Main Verb**

### Examples
- **Can I borrow your car for the weekend?**  
  (Yes, just be careful with it. / Sorry, I need it myself.)
- **Could you help me with my project after work?**  
  (Of course, I’d be happy to help.)
- **Should we leave early to avoid traffic?**  
  (Yes, leaving early sounds like a good idea.)
- **Will you attend the conference next month?**  
  (Yes, I already registered for it.)

## 4. **Tag Questions**

Tag questions are used to confirm information, usually expecting a "yes" or "no" response. They are often used in conversation to seek agreement.

### Structure
- **Statement + Inverted Tag**

### Examples
- **You’re joining us for dinner, aren’t you?**  
  (Yes, I’ll be there. / No, I won’t make it tonight.)
- **She didn’t finish the report, did she?**  
  (No, she’s still working on it. / Actually, yes, she finished it yesterday.)
- **It’s going to rain, isn’t it?**  
  (Yes, I checked the weather. / No, I think it’ll stay clear.)

**Tip:** If the main sentence is affirmative, the tag is negative, and vice versa.

---

## 5. **Indirect Questions**

Indirect questions are more formal and polite, often used in professional or polite contexts. They start with phrases like "Could you tell me…" or "I’d like to know…".

### Structure
- **Introductory Phrase + Wh- Word + Subject + Main Verb**

### Examples
- **Could you tell me how to get to the nearest bus station?**  
  (Yes, walk straight ahead and take the second left.)
- **I’d like to know what time the presentation begins.**  
  (The presentation starts at 2 p.m.)
- **Do you know if there’s a discount available for students?**  
  (Yes, they offer a 10% discount.)
- **Can you explain why the project was delayed?**  
  (The delay was due to some technical issues.)

**Tip:** In indirect questions, the word order remains like a statement (subject before verb), and there’s no inversion.
