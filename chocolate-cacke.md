## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Oven

- **Preheat the Oven**: Set the oven to 350°F (175°C). This will allow it to heat up properly while you prepare the batter.
- **Prepare the Pans**: Grease two round 9-inch cake pans with butter or cooking spray, then dust them with flour or line them with parchment paper. This will prevent the cakes from sticking.

### 2. Make the Cake Batter

- **Combine the Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix them well with a whisk.
- **Add the Wet Ingredients**: Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the bowl with the dry ingredients. Using a hand mixer or whisk, beat until the batter is smooth and well-combined.
- **Add Boiling Water**: Carefully pour in the boiling water and mix until everything is well-blended. The batter will be thin – this is normal.

### 3. Bake the Cake

- **Divide the Batter**: Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.
- **Bake**: Place the pans in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
- **Cool the Cakes**: Let the cakes cool in their pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully remove them and place them on a wire rack to cool completely before adding the filling.

### 4. Prepare the Chocolate Filling

- **Heat the Cream**: In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer (do not boil).
- **Add the Chocolate**: Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the chopped chocolate or chocolate chips. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
- **Cool and Thicken**: Let the mixture cool at room temperature until it thickens into a creamy consistency, which may take 1-2 hours.

### 5. Assemble the Cake

- **Layer the Cake**: Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of the chocolate filling on top.
- **Add the Second Layer**: Place the second layer of cake on top, pressing down slightly to make sure it sticks.
- **Cover with the Remaining Filling**: Spread the remaining filling on top of the cake and along the sides for a beautiful finish.

## Texture, Smell, and Taste of the Cake

### Texture:
The cake should be light, fluffy, and moist due to the boiling water and well-combined ingredients. The filling will be creamy and smooth, adding a rich layer of texture when you slice into the cake.

### Smell:
The aroma of chocolate will fill your kitchen as the cake bakes, and the scent will intensify with the chocolate filling. The vanilla also adds a sweet, comforting scent.

### Taste:
This chocolate cake will taste rich and decadent. The chocolate flavor is deep and satisfying, complemented by the creamy, slightly sweet filling. Each bite should be a balance of soft cake and smooth chocolate filling, perfect for any chocolate lover.
