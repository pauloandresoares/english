## 1 - HISTORY OF COFFEE AND PRODUCTION

The story of coffee dates back centuries, with its origins believed to be in the **Ethiopian highlands**. According to legend, a goat herder named **Kaldi** noticed that his goats became very energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Kaldi shared his discovery with local monks, who then used the berries to stay awake during long hours of prayer. Eventually, word spread to the Arabian Peninsula, and coffee became a part of daily life in the Middle East, North Africa, and later Europe.

### Coffee Farming: From Seed to Harvest

Coffee production begins on **coffee farms** where the coffee plant (*Coffea arabica* or *Coffea canephora*, known as *robusta*) is grown. Let’s break down the process:

### 1. **Planting**
   - Coffee grows best in tropical climates with plenty of rain and stable temperatures. Farmers plant coffee seeds in **nurseries** and later transplant the young plants to their fields.
   - **Irrigation** systems are often used to ensure the coffee plants receive sufficient water, especially during dry seasons.

### 2. **Growth and Cultivation**
   - Coffee plants take 3 to 4 years to mature and begin producing fruit, known as **coffee cherries**. During this time, the plants need careful attention, including regular watering and pruning.
   - Farmers monitor the weather and seasonal changes, ensuring the plants get the right balance of sunlight and water.

### 3. **Harvesting**
   - Once the coffee cherries are ripe (typically turning red), the **harvest** begins. Harvesting is often done by hand to ensure that only the ripe cherries are picked, although in some larger farms, machines may be used.
   - The timing of the **harvest season** is crucial, as harvesting too early or too late can affect the quality of the beans.

### 4. **Processing the Coffee Cherries**
   - After harvesting, coffee cherries must be processed to extract the beans inside. There are two main methods:
     - **Dry processing**: The cherries are laid out in the sun to dry naturally.
     - **Wet processing**: The cherries are washed, and the pulp is removed before the beans are dried.
   - The processing method greatly impacts the flavor of the coffee.

### 5. **Sorting and Grading**
   - Once processed, the beans are sorted and graded according to size, shape, and quality. Different **lots** are created, and higher-quality beans are often sold at a premium.
   - Beans are inspected and tested to ensure they meet quality standards before being shipped.

### 6. **Exporting**
   - Coffee beans are a major export product for many countries. After grading, the beans are packaged and shipped to markets around the world. This step, known as **exportation**, is crucial for the economies of coffee-producing countries.
   - The **profit** generated from coffee sales is important for the livelihoods of many farmers.

### 7. **Roasting and Selling**
   - Once the beans are exported, they are **roasted** to develop their flavor. Roasting can be done on a small scale or in large factories, depending on the demand. After roasting, coffee is packaged and sold to consumers.

## 2 - INTRODUCTION TO COFFEE AND COFFEE EQUIPMENT

![Coffe Equipment](images/coffe.png)


1. **Coffee Filter**  
   - **Purpose:** A coffee filter is used to separate the coffee grounds from the brewed liquid. In a pour-over method, water is poured over the grounds, and the filter prevents the grounds from entering the cup while allowing the brewed coffee to pass through.
   
2. **Espresso Maker**  
   - **Purpose:** This is a stovetop espresso maker, also known as a "Moka pot." It uses steam pressure to force water through finely-ground coffee, brewing a strong and concentrated coffee similar to espresso.

3. **Milk Jug**  
   - **Purpose:** The milk jug is used to hold and pour milk, especially when making drinks like a latte or cappuccino. In some cases, it's used to froth milk using a steam wand or a frothing tool.

4. **Capsules**  
   - **Purpose:** Coffee capsules or pods are pre-packaged portions of ground coffee. They are used in specific coffee machines that brew coffee by piercing the capsule and forcing hot water through it.

5. **Coffee Beans**  
   - **Purpose:** Coffee beans are the seeds of the coffee plant and the foundation for any coffee drink. These are roasted and ground before brewing. Whole beans are preferred by many because they maintain their flavor longer than pre-ground coffee.

6. **Ground Coffee**  
   - **Purpose:** This is coffee that has already been ground from beans. Ground coffee is ready to be used in various brewing methods such as drip coffee makers, French presses, or espresso machines.

7. **Sugar Bowl**  
   - **Purpose:** A small container used to store sugar, which can be added to coffee to sweeten it. Many people enjoy a bit of sugar to balance the bitterness of coffee.

8. **Coffee with Milk / Latte**  
   - **Purpose:** This refers to a coffee drink that combines coffee with steamed milk. A latte typically has more milk than coffee and is smooth and creamy.

9. **Cup**  
   - **Purpose:** A small cup used to serve coffee, often for a shot of espresso or a black coffee.

10. **Black Coffee**  
    - **Purpose:** This is coffee served without any additives like milk or sugar. It’s strong and retains the natural bitterness and flavor of the coffee beans.

11. **Mug**  
    - **Purpose:** A larger cup, typically used for serving coffee with milk or larger portions of black coffee. Mugs are often used for casual, everyday coffee drinking.

12. **Saucer**  
    - **Purpose:** A small dish placed under the coffee cup to catch any spills and to hold a spoon or small snack that might accompany the coffee.

13. **Coffee Powder (Ground Coffee):** This is the final product after grinding coffee beans. The fineness of the grind depends on the brewing method; espresso machines use fine grounds, while French presses require coarse grounds. The freshness of the ground coffee plays a huge role in the flavor and aroma of the brewed coffee.

## 3 - ARTICLE: HOW TO GRIND COFFEE BEANS LIKE A PRO

Sipping a delicious cup of coffee in the morning is a delightful ritual for most Americans. From the first whiff of fresh coffee beans wafting from the package to the sounds of your percolator, single-serve, or drip brewer, making coffee is a comforting way to start the day.

Among U.S. households that consume coffee, only 20% use whole bean coffee at least some of the time. This means that most coffee drinkers buy and prepare ground coffee at home. Buying your coffee ground certainly saves time and energy when you're on the go, but learning how to properly grind coffee beans at home can make a big difference in the flavor and textures you experience.

---

### Why Does Grind Size Matter?

Grinding whole bean coffee right before you brew it ensures maximum freshness and flavor. Roasted coffee contains volatile oils that impart most of the flavors you taste when you consume coffee. Once beans are ground, these oils react with oxygen and evaporate. The longer your ground coffee is exposed to the air, the more flavor it may lose.

Additionally, how water interacts with your coffee during brewing profoundly affects taste and mouthfeel. Your grind size and texture are important because the more contact water has with the coffee during brewing, the quicker it will be extracted. You could accidentally prevent extraction if your grind is too fine for your brewing method.

If your grind is too coarse, water may move through your coffee too quickly and produce a weak, tasteless cup. In other words, over-ground or too fine coffee can be over-extracted during brewing and result in a bitter taste. Coffee that is under-ground or too coarse can be under-extracted during brewing and result in watery, weak, or sour-tasting coffee.

### Grind Sizes

Learning how to grind coffee beans like a pro requires an understanding of the different sizes, textures, and brewing methods you can use to prepare coffee. Now that you know why grinding coffee beans matters, here are the most common names and sizes of grinds you can try at home.

- **Whole bean coffee** is not a type of grind per se, but it is essential to know the term. Whole bean refers to un-ground coffee and is the best choice for fresh coffee prepared at home.
- **Coarse grind** is best for immersion brewing methods where water has a lot of contact with the coffee while brewing. A coarse grind should have the texture of gritty and granular grains you can see with the naked eye. Compare to sea salt crystals.
- **Medium coarse** is slightly more refined than a coarse grind used for French Press and immersion brewing and is a great choice for large pour-over brewers like the Chemex, Moccamaster, and Kalita.
- **Medium** is the best grind size for automatic drip brewers and the most common size you'll find at the grocery store or on the shelf at your corner coffee shop. Medium grinds work best in automatic home brewers and should resemble the size and texture of fine beach sand or flaky sea salt.
- **Medium fine** is a fine grind for single-cup brewers like a Hario pour-over or traditional AeroPress.
- **Fine** is the perfect grind size for espresso machines and manual espresso brewers like a Moka Pot or inverted AeroPress.
- **Extra fine** is a powdery grind used for making Turkish coffee. The consistency should resemble all-purpose flour or baker's cocoa powder.

### Brewing Methods

Now that you are familiar with some of the most common names and sizes of grinds, it's time to pair them with your favorite brewing method like an expert.

- **Immersion brewing** includes methods such as French Press, percolator, and coffee cupping. During immersion brewing, ground coffee has contact with the water for an extended time, so a coarse or medium-coarse grind is most effective and flavorful.
- **Drip brewing** is the most popular brew method in the U.S. and includes automatic drip and single-serve machines. Use a medium grind for electric brewing methods, and you'll have a delicious and quick cup.
- **Pour Over** includes Hario pour-over, Chemex, and other cone-filtered methods where water is poured by hand over the ground coffee. Manual brewing gives you more flexibility and room to experiment and determine what you like since you control water flow. Try a medium coarse grind for multi-cup brewers like the Chemex or a medium-fine grind for single-cup pour-overs like the Hario or traditional AeroPress.
- **Pressure extraction brewing** includes espresso brewing and AeroPress methods. Pressure extraction forces hot water through tightly packed and finely ground coffee to produce a robust shot with a silky layer of foam on top, known as crema. Use a fine grind to get that straight-from-the-barista flavor and texture.
- **Cold brewing coffee** is slightly different since there is no heat to expedite the brewing process. Because cold brewing coffee takes up to 8 hours, it is important to use a coarse grind that resembles cracked peppercorns.
- **Turkish coffee** combines extra finely ground coffee with sugar, water, and spices, boiling it in a small pot. An extra-fine grind is essential because Turkish coffee is served unfiltered.

### At-Home Machines for Grinding Beans

You're well on your way to mastering the art of grinding coffee beans and becoming a grind guru. Now it's time to discuss the different grinders you can purchase for your home. There are four main types of grinders to look for and compare.

- **Blade grinders** are the most common type of home coffee grinder you can find at a kitchen equipment store near you. They feature a simple blade at the bottom of the vessel and a few speed settings. Blade grinders are best for coarse to medium grinds because their limited speed settings and single blade can deliver inconsistent results.
- **Burr grinders** are the preferred home grinders for many at-home coffee aficionados. Their multi-blade system creates more surfaces for coffee bean crushing, which results in a more even and consistent grind.
- **Conical burr grinders** are professional-grade grinders you see at your local cafe. Their conical shape and multiple speed settings provide the most accurate grind sizes and textures.
- **Hand grinders** are great for gourmet coffee on the go or making sure you can still prep your morning cup when the power goes out. Hand grinders used to be the most common at-home bean grinding machines but have become less common with the advent of electric grinders.

### How to Grind Coffee Beans Without a Grinder

If you're ready to experiment with coffee grinds but not quite prepared to invest in an at-home grinder, there are many ways to test your technique and taste with the tools you already have.

- Use a **blender** to experiment with coarse and medium grinds at home. The simple blades and low-speed setting should give you decent results.
- Use a **mortar and pestle** to get a consistent medium-fine to fine grind. It will take some time and elbow grease, but you should get excellent results.
- Use a **food processor** to pulse beans to your desired texture. Try grinding a small amount (about 1/2 cup) of whole beans at a time for more consistent results.
- Several other kitchen tools, from rolling pins to meat tenderizers and kitchen knives, can be used to chop, crush, and grind. Experiment and have fun!
